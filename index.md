# Bio

I am a Pre-Doctoral Researcher at Google AI India.

My research focuses on reinforcement learning and multi-agent systems with application in robotics, public health and environmental conservation. On a fundamental research side, I'm interested in developing agents that learn behaviours which are transferable to real-world domains, are scalable through communication and are understandable and acceptable by humans.

Previously, I was a Data Scientist at United Health Group where I worked on modelling healthcare risks for millions of beneficiaries.
My CV is available [here][33].

I graduated from [Indian Institute of Information Technology and Management Gwalior](iiitm.ac.in) in 2020.
During my undergrad years, both my Bachelor's and Master's Thesis had been graded as Outstanding. I have also actively contributed to Open Source Scientific Computing Community with feature additions and patches in projects such as OpenCV, AstroPy, SciPy, Shogun ML Toolkit, Chainer and TensorForce. 

On the side, I maintain [Jupyer Probe](https://pypi.org/project/jupyter-probe/), a library to monitor, manage, declare and analyse notebook resource usage on jupyter environments.
I am also an avid bird watcher and photographer and post pictures from my adventures on [Instagram](instagram.com/hisblahness).
